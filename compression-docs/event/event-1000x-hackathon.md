## Judging

Participants must submit their project to the hackathon before May 16, 2025, to be eligible for prizes. Once all submissions are collected, we will distribute a list to the side-track judges for evaluation. Additionally, the Breakout Hackathon's submission rules apply.

Teams and individuals are evaluated on the following criteria:

* Functionality
* Potential impact
* Novelty
* Design
* Extensibility

The Solana Foundation cPop and cPay prizes are subject to dedicated requirements listed below\*.&#x20;

After the judges complete individual evaluations, they will discuss and choose the winners based on the project's weighted scores.
