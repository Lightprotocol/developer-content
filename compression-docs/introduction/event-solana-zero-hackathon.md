To be eligible for the side track, participants must register in the project registration form shared above and submit their project to the Radar Hackathon before October 2, 2024. Once all submissions are collected, we will distribute a list to the side-track judges for evaluation.

Teams and individuals are evaluated on the following criteria:

After the judges complete individual evaluations, they will discuss and choose the winners based on the project's weighted scores.
