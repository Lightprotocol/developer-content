## Judging

To be eligible for Solana Zero prizes, participants must submit their project to the Hackathon before October 8, 2024. Once all submissions are collected, we will distribute a list to the side-track judges for evaluation. Additionally, the Radar Hackathon's [submission rules](https://www.colosseum.org/\_app/immutable/assets/Solana%20Radar%20Hackathon%20Official%20Rules%202024.8c044e21.pdf) apply.

Teams and individuals are evaluated on the following criteria:

* Functionality
* Potential impact
* Novelty
* Design
* Extensibility

After the judges complete individual evaluations, they will discuss and choose the winners based on the project's weighted scores.
