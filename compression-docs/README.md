# Introduction

The ZK Compression project aims to help developers reduce high Solana rent costs through state compression. It introduces a generalized compression programming model, enabling developers to create compressed accounts that function nearly identically to Solana's native accounts. Additionally, developers have the flexibility to design their own compressed programs and take advantage of the native compressed token program.

The project also includes:

1. A block explorer that natively supports compressed accounts
2. A CLI for setting up the compression programs and running the indexer locally
3. A series of guides and examples

The project is a joint venture by Light Protocol and Helius Labs, supported by Solana Labs.  Our aspiration is for this initiative to become the standard compression layer within the Solana ecosystem.
