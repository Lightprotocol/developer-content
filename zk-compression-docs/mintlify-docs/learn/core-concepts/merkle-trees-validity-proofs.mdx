## Overview

The protocol uses two types of Merkle trees that serve different purposes:

- [**State trees**](#state-trees) store compressed account hashes
- [**Address trees**](#address-merkle-trees) store addresses that serve as persistent identifiers

The protocol maintains multiple Merkle trees to reduce write-lock contention. Solana's runtime locks accounts during writes, wherefore a single tree would become a bottleneck. Multiple trees allow parallel transactions.

<Check>
Developers don't need to maintain or initialize Merkle trees themselves.

## State trees

A state tree is a binary Merkle tree that stores data of millions of compressed Solana accounts in leaves for efficient cryptographic verification the integrity of all leaves in a tree.

<Steps>
<Step title="Merkle Tree Structure">

A Merkle tree compresses data by hashing adjacent leaves repeatedly into a single root hash, starting from the lowest level. The hash of a compressed Solana account is stored as a leaf in a State tree.
</Step>

<Step title="Merkle Root Hash">

Only this root hash is stored on chain as single value on chain to secure the integrity of all compressed state in a tree. The raw state can thus be stored as calldata in the much cheaper Solana ledger space while preserving Solana's security guarantees.

</Step>

<Step title="Leaf Hash Structure: Compressed Account Hashes">

For compressed Solana accounts, the 32 byte leaf hashes effectively mirror the regular Solana account layout: `{DataHash, StateHash; Owner, Lamports`.

The `data_hash` represents the fingerprint of the actual account data.

The `state_hash` ensures that each account hash is globally unique. It includes

* the public key of the state tree's respective on-chain account (i.e., `state_tree_hash`) and
* the compressed account's position in the tree (i.e., `leafIndex`).

Lastly, `owner_hashed` determines which program owns this account and `lamports` show the account balance.

<Note>
For [details on the compressed account structure see this section](/learn/core-concepts/compressed-account-model#compressed-account-structure).

</Step>

<Step title="Merkle and Validity Proofs">

In state trees, a <Tooltip tip="are succinct zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)">validity proof</Tooltip> verifies that a compressed account exists in state trees with a constant 128-byte proof size. This proof must be included in every transaction once a compressed account is created to verify the on-chain state.

<Check>
- Developers don't need to generate validity proofs or learn about ZK to use ZK Compression.
- ZK Compression uses [Groth16](https://docs.rs/groth16-solana/latest/groth16_solana/), a well-known [pairing-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing-based_cryptography) [zk-SNARK](https://www.helius.dev/blog/zero-knowledge-proofs-its-applications-on-solana#-zk-snarks-and-circuits), for its proof system.
</Check>

The validity proof contains one or more merkle proofs:

- Merkle proofs consist of sibling node hashes along the path from the account's leaf to the root.
- Starting with the leaf hash, the verifier calculates up the tree using these sibling hashes. The proof path is shown with three highlighted elements in a box at the bottom right: Leaf 0, Node 1, and Node 5, representing the sibling hashes needed to verify Leaf 1.
- If the calculated root matches the on-chain root, the account is verified.

For a tree with height 26, a single proof requires 26 sibling hashes (32 bytes each) plus metadata totaling 832 bytes. The proof size grows with tree height.

ZK Compression batches multiple Merkle proofs into a single zero-knowledge proof to achieve a constant 128-byte size regardless of how many accounts are verified:

| Accounts Verified | Proof Components      | Size          |
|:-|:-|:-|
| 1                 | 1 merkle proof        | 832 <Tooltip tip="tree height 26 with v1 state trees of ZK Compression">bytes</Tooltip> |
| 1                 | 1 merkle + 1 ZK proof | 128 bytes |
| 8                 | 8 merkle + 1 ZK proof | 128 bytes |

<Info>
Two **state tree versions** with different proof mechanisms are currently supported:

- **V1 state trees**: Always require the full 128-byte ZK proof
- **V2 batched state trees**: Can use `prove_by_index` optimization that verifies the account exists with only one byte instead of 128-bytes.

**V2** optimizes optimize compute unit consumption by up to 70% and is **currently on Devnet**.

When using V2 trees, RPC requests automatically choose the proof mechanism.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Address trees

Address trees store addresses that serve as optional, persistent identifiers for compressed accounts.

<Info>
Every address is unique within its address tree, but the same seeds can create different addresses in different address trees. To enforce that a compressed account can only be created once with the same seed, check the address tree pubkey in your program.
</Info>

<Steps>
<Step title="Address Tree Structure">

Address trees store derived addresses in an indexed structure. Unlike state trees that store account hashes, address trees store the actual address values along with pointers to maintain sorted order.

These addresses are used only when compressed accounts require a persistent identifier that doesn't change when the account data updates.
</Step>

<Step title="Address Tree Root Hash">

Like state trees, only the root hash is stored on-chain to verify all addresses in the tree. The raw addresses are stored in the Solana ledger.
</Step>

<Step title="Merkle and Validity Proofs">

In address trees, validity proofs verify when creating a compressed account with an address that the address doesn't already exist in a specified address tree. This constant 128-byte proof must be included in the transaction only when creating accounts with addresses, not for subsequent compressed account interactions.

<Info>
Two **address tree versions** are currently supported:

- **V1 address trees** height 26 (\~67 million addresses).
- **V2 batched address trees** with height 40 (\~1 trillion addresses).

**V2** optimizes optimize compute unit consumption by up to 70% and is **currently on Devnet**.

When using V2 trees, RPC requests automatically choose the proof mechanism.
