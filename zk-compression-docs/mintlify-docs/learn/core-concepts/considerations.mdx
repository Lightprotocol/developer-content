## Overview

Before using ZK Compression to scale your application state, consider the following limitations of compressed accounts:

- Larger Transaction Size
- High Compute Unit Usage
- Per-Transaction State Cost

## General Recommendation

<Check>
Consider which accounts in your application benefit from ZK Compression and which don't.
- You can use both types for different parts of your application.
- You can decompress and compress accounts at will.
</Check>

It may be preferred for an account _not_ to be permanently compressed if:

- The account gets updated very frequently within a single block (e.g., shared liquidity pools in a DeFi protocol).
- You expect the lifetime number of writes to the same account to be very large (>>1000x).
- The account stores large amounts of data, and you need to access a large part of it (>1kb) inside one on-chain transaction.

## Larger Transaction Size

Solana's transaction size limit is 1232 Bytes. Transactions exceeding this limit will fail. ZK Compression increases your transaction size in two ways:

- 128 bytes must be reserved for the validity proof, which is a constant size per transaction, assuming the transaction reads from at least one compressed account.
- You must send the account data you want to read/write on-chain.

## High Compute Unit Usage

<Info>
System CU usage:

- \~100,000 CU for validity proof verification, which is a constant size per transaction, assuming the transaction reads from at least one compressed account
- \~100,000 CU system use (state tree [Poseidon](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf) hashing et al.)
- \~6,000 CU per compressed account read/write

**Example**: a typical compressed token transfer uses around 292,000 CU.
</Info>

Higher CU usage can:

- **Lead to usage limits:** The total CU limit per transaction is 1,400,000 CU, and the per-block write lock limit per State tree is 12,000,000 CU.
- **Require your users to increase their** [**priority fee**](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/how-to-use-priority-fees) **during congestion:** Whenever Solana's global per-block CU limit (48,000,000 CU) is reached, validator clients may prioritize transactions with higher per-CU priority fees.

## State Cost per Transaction

Each write operation incurs a small additional network cost. If you expect a single compressed account to amass a large amount of state updates, the lifetime cost of the compressed account may be higher than its uncompressed equivalent, which currently has a fixed per-byte rent cost at creation.

<Info>
Whenever a transaction writes to a compressed account, it nullifies the previous compressed account state and appends the new compressed account as a leaf to the state tree. Both of these actions incur costs that add to Solana's base fee.
</Info>

| Type | Lamports | Notes |
|:-|:-|:-|
| **Solana base fee** | `5000` per signature | Compensates validators for processing transactions |
| **Write new compressed account state** | ~`300` per leaf (default) | Depends on tree depth:<br/>( 2<sup>tree_depth</sup> × tree_account_rent_cost × rollover_threshold)<br/>≈ `300` for the default depth of `26` |
| **Nullify old compressed account state** | `5000` per transaction | Reimburses the cost of running a Forester transaction. The current default Forester node implementation can be found here |
| **Create addresses** | `5000` per transaction | Same as nullify |
