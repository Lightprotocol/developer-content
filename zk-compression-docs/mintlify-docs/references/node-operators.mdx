<Check>
Developers don't need to run any nodes to use ZK Compression.
</Check>

To connect to public networks (i.e., Devnet, Mainnet-Beta), you can either work with an RPC infrastructure provider that supports ZK Compression, such as [Helius Labs](https://helius.xyz/), or run your own nodes.

<Info>
There are three different types of nodes:

- Photon RPC nodes
- Prover nodes
- Light forester nodes
</Info>

#### Photon Indexer Node

Indexer nodes use an existing connection to a Solana RPC full node to parse the transactions involving Light Protocol programs, enabling clients to read and write zk-compressed state.

The canonical ZK Compression indexer is named Photon and is maintained by Helius Labs. It is fully open-source, and can be run locally. To set it up, simply point it to an existing Solana RPC. See the [Github repo](https://github.com/helius-labs/photon) for more info.

#### Prover Node

Provers generate validity proofs for state inclusion and PDA uniqueness on behalf of app developers

**Prover nodes** can be operated either standalone or with an RPC node: in its default configuration, the Photon RPC node implementation by [Helius Labs](https://github.com/helius-labs/photon) bundles a Prover node. The ZK Compression RPC API specification supports proof generation via the `getValidityProof` endpoint, making it easy to serve proofs using regular RPC methods via the same port.

Please refer to the [Github repo](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/light-prover) for more info:

#### Forester Node

These nodes manage the creation, rollover, and updating of shared and program-owned state trees. Running a forester node is permissionless for your own state trees.
