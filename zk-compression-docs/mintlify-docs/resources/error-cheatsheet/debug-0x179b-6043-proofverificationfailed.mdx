### Common causes and Debug Steps

<Info>
For a complete example of proper client+on chain flows, see the [Counter Program](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/blob/main/counter/anchor/programs/counter/src/lib.rs#L26).
</Info>

<Accordion title="Inconsistent Address Seed - Client seeds don't match on chain address derivation">

Compare client vs on chain seeds/addresses. Both should be identical.

```typescript
// Client - log seeds/address used to request proof
console.log("Client seeds:", seeds, "address:", address);
```

```rust
// Onchain - log seeds/address
msg!("Program seeds: {:?}, address: {:?}", seeds, address);
```

</Accordion>
