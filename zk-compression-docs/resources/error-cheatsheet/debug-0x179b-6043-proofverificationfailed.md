# Debug 0x179b / 6043 / ProofVerificationFailed

### Description

You're passing an invalid proof. The proof provided cannot be verified against the expected state.

{% hint style="success" %}
For help with debugging use the [MCP Configuration](../../references/ai-tools-guide.md#mcp) or AskDevin via [![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol).
{% endhint %}

### **Common causes and Debug Steps**

{% hint style="info" %}
For a complete example of proper client+on chain flows, see the [Counter Program](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/blob/main/counter/anchor/programs/counter/src/lib.rs#L26).
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Inconsistent Address Seed - Client seeds don't match on chain address derivation</summary>

Compare client vs on chain seeds/addresses. Both should be identical.

```typescript
// Client - log seeds/address used to request proof
console.log("Client seeds:", seeds, "address:", address);
```

```rust
// Onchain - log seeds/address
msg!("Program seeds: {:?}, address: {:?}", seeds, address);
```
