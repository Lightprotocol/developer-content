# Introduction

## What is the LightLayer? <a href="#what-is-light" id="what-is-light"></a>

Light is a protocol built on Solana that introduces **ZK compression.** This primitive enables the secure scaling of state directly on the L1.

## **Why build with Light?**

**Hyperscale state:** Solana users and program developers can opt-in to compress their on-chain state via the LightLayer smart contracts. This reduces state cost by orders of magnitude while preserving the security, performance, and composability of the Solana L1.

**A new design space for computation**: in addition to classic on-chain compute, compressed state via the LightLayer natively supports custom ZK compute, enabling previously impossible computation designs on Solana.

The LightLayer is being built in the [open](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol), with a public beta coming soon. Stay up-to-date with the teams contributing to ZK compression and its RPC implementation: [Light](https://twitter.com/LightProtocol) and [Helius](https://twitter.com/heliuslabs).
