### SSP / Compressed Program

**S**tateless **S**olana **P**rogram. also known as "Compressed Program". Smart contracts that interact with state via the LightLayer. Includes regular anchor programs that fully execute on-chain as well as programs that run custom off-chain compute over Light state.



### Compressed State / Light state



### Compressed Account



### ZK Compression



### Forrester node



### Merkle tree / State tree



### Validity proof / ZKP



### Groth16

Groth16 is a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system used within Light for efficient proof generation and verification. Proofs are short (256 bytes / 128 bytes compressed) which is important for on-chain verificaiton on Solana. Groth16 proofs belong to the family of SNARKs. (**S**uccinct **N**on-interactive **Ar**guments of **K**nowledge).
