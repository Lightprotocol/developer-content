# Introduction

## What is Light Protocol? <a href="#what-is-light" id="what-is-light"></a>

Light is a protocol built on Solana that introduces **ZK compression,** a primitive that enables secure scaling directly on the L1.

## **Why build with Light?**

**Hyperscale state:** Solana users and program developers can opt to compress their on-chain state via the Light Protocol smart contracts, reducing state cost by orders of magnitude while preserving the security, performance, and composability of the Solana L1.

**A new design space for computation**: In addition to classic on-chain compute, compressed state via Light natively supports custom ZK compute, enabling developers to build previously impossible computation designs on Solana.
