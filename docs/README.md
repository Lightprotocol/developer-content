# Introduction

### What is Light?

Light is a protocol built on Solana that introduces ZK compression, a new primitive that enables the secure scaling of state and compute directly on the L1.

State: Solana program developers can opt-in to compress their on-chain state via the LightLayer smart contracts, thereby reducing the cost of state by 100x - 1000x while maintaining the security, performance, and composability of L1 execution and Data Availability.

Compute: State that is compressed via the LightLayer is natively compatible with arbitrary ZK computation, which can enable previously impossible types of computation and applications directly on the Solana L1.
