# Introduction

### What is Light?

Light is a protocol built on Solana introducing **ZK compression**, a new primitive that enables the secure scaling of state directly on the L1.

**Hyperscale state:** Solana users and program developers can opt-in to compress their on-chain state via the LightLayer smart contracts. This reduces state cost by orders of magnitude while preserving the security, performance, and composability of the Solana L1.\
\
**Expand the design space for computation**: Compressed state via the LightLayer natively supports custom ZK compute, enabling previously impossible computation designs on Solana.\

The LightLayer is being built in the [open](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol) and is currently in private alpha. Stay up to date with the teams contributing to ZK compression and its RPC implementation: [Light](https://twitter.com/LightProtocol) and [Helius](https://twitter.com/heliuslabs).
