***

1\.        ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF USE

1.1.  These terms of use are entered into by and between you and Light Protocol Labs (“Light Protocol”, “we” or “us”). The following terms of use, together with any documents namely incorporated by reference (collectively, these “Terms of Use”), govern the use by you (“you”, and in its variants including “your”) of Light Protocol’s Solana based protocol and its associated software and documentation, including ZK Compression (collectively, the “Protocol”) made available on GitHub.

1.2.  These Terms of Use apply exclusively to the Protocol and does not cover any other protocols or software available from Light Protocol or any other parties, whether accessible through GitHub or elsewhere. We do not own, control, or bear any responsibility for these third parties materials and tools, such as protocols or smart contracts, namely the Solana Protocol, which is controlled, maintained, and/or operated by third parties. Please consult the relevant third parties’ user agreements for information regarding your rights and the associated risks with your use of and access to the respective protocols and related materials.

1.3.  When the user uses the Protocol under the authority of another person or entity, such as an employer, then “you” (and any related terms like “your”) refers to the party on whose behalf the Protocol is being used. Additionally, if someone else is using the Protocol on your behalf, you accept full responsibility for their actions or inactions, as though they were your own.

&#x20;

2\.        AMENDMENTS TO THE TERMS OF USE

2.1.  We may update these Terms of Use at any time. The changes will take effect immediately upon posting and apply for all use of the Protocol thereafter.

2.2.  Changes to the Governing Law and dispute resolution section will not apply to any disputes known before the date of posting.

&#x20;

3\.        PROTOCOL FUNCTIONALITY, SECURITY AND RISKS

3.1.  The Protocol is an open-source solution to network congestion and data storage costs on Solana in a way, that it enables compressed transactions and accounts. This minimises cost by securely storing specific kinds of data on cheaper ledger space instead of the more expensive account space.

3.1.1.     The Protocol includes the system program and compressed token program, which are made available publicly, and runs on open-source self executing smart contracts.

3.1.2.     The Protocol requires keeper nodes called "foresters" (“Forester” or “Foresters”) to function. The Foresters constantly empties queues of transactions in an asynchronous process to ensure network liveness. Foresters have no influence on compressed transactions or accounts and do not interact with users.

3.1.3.     The Protocol is not centrally operated due to the use of a multi-signature system, with its addresses made publicly available here \<LINK TO MULTI SIG ADDRESSES>

3.2.  We prioritize the security of the Protocol and have implemented measures to mitigate potential risks, as detailed in our [security section](broken-reference).

3.2.1.     However, since the Protocol is built on open-source software, it may contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could adversely affect its functionality. In rare but severe cases, these issues could lead to the loss of your digital assets or your ability to access your digital wallet.

3.2.2.     You recognize that hackers or other malicious individuals may attempt to disrupt the Protocol or your use of it through various means, including but not limited to deploying malicious software, conducting denial-of-service attacks, performing Sybil attacks, or engaging in spoofing activities.

3.2.3.     By using the Protocol, you acknowledge and accept these inherent risks. You agree to release us from any liability and hold us harmless for any losses you may incur as a result of such vulnerabilities or malicious activities.

3.2.4.     You acknowledge that the Protocol may utilize, incorporate, or provide links to certain open-source components. Your use of the Protocol is subject to any applicable open-source licenses governing these components, and you agree to comply with all such license terms.

3.3.  Light Protocol does not hold your digital assets, nor does it take custody of them.

3.3.1.     We have no access to your assets or funds. Neither the Protocol or Light Protocol has control over the private keys of any assets belonging to users. It is a user’s responsibility to ensure to maintain control of her digital assets and she have sole responsibility for exchanging them.

3.3.2.     You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any losses arising from your digital asset transactions and exchanges. You commit to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from any claims or losses that you or others may incur as a result of your digital asset transactions, even if you executed these transactions by following documenation or instructions available in the Protocol.

3.3.3.     We are not your financial advisors and do not offer any investment advice concerning your use or exchange of digital assets.
