# ZK Compression

Light's core primitive is **ZK Compression**. This section is a directory guiding you to the relevant codebases, examples, and advanced guides.

{% hint style="info" %}
We're hosting in-depth documentation and guides at [zkcompression.com](https://www.zkcompression.com) with the Helius team.

### 5. JSON RPC Methods

These pages outline all ZK Compression methods extending Solana's [default JSON RPC API](https://solana.com/docs/rpc). Helius Labs maintains the [canonical RPC API and indexer implementation](https://github.com/helius-labs/photon).

### 6. Run a Node for ZK Compression

This section covers setting up a node for development on public Networks. For public networks (i.e., Devnet, Mainnet-Beta), you can either work with an RPC infrastructure provider that supports ZK Compression, such as [Helius Labs](https://helius.xyz/), or run your own nodes (Photon RPC, Prover, or Forester).&#x20;

_Becoming an operator for any node type is permissionless._
