# ZK Compression

Light's core primitive is **ZK Compression**. This section is a directory guiding you to the relevant codebases, examples, and advanced guides.

{% hint style="info" %}
We're hosting in-depth documentation and guides at [zkcompression.com](https://www.zkcompression.com) togheter with the Helius team.

### 2. TypeScript Client

Our TypeScript library provides the tools you need to interact with ZK Compression using the JSON RPC API. It aims to provide all the necessary functionality to interact with the ZK Compression primitive.

### 4. JSON RPC Methods

These pages outline all ZK Compression methods extending Solana's [default JSON RPC API](https://solana.com/docs/rpc). Helius Labs maintains the [canonical RPC API and indexer implementation](https://github.com/helius-labs/photon).

### 5. Run a Node for ZK Compression

This section covers setting up a node for Local and public Development. For public networks (i.e., Devnet, Mainnet-Beta), you can either work with an RPC infrastructure provider that supports ZK Compression, such as [Helius Labs](https://helius.xyz/), or run your own nodes (Photon RPC, Prover, or Forester).&#x20;

_Becoming an operator for any node type is permissionless._
