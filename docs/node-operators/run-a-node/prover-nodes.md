# Prover node



Prover nodes allow users to outsource validity proof generation.

Every user transaction that spends compressed state (e.g. updating compressed accounts) must submit a validity proof to the chain. These validity proofs prove that given input state was previously appended to the state stress and is therefore valid, unspent state.\
The Light system programs verify these validityProofs on-chain.
