# Node Operator Guide

### What is a Node Operator within the LightLayer?[â€‹](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-introduction#what-is-a-node-operator-within-eigenlayer) <a href="#what-is-a-node-operator-within-eigenlayer" id="what-is-a-node-operator-within-eigenlayer"></a>

Operators, who can be either individuals or organizations, play an active role in the Light protocol.&#x20;

There are three different types of nodes within Light:

**Forrester nodes -** plant and update public and program-owned state trees.

**Prover nodes -** allow app and wallet developers to outsource validity proof generation.

**RPC nodes - -** index the chain and enable app developers to create transactions that interact with Light state.
