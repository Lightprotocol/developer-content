### SSP / Compressed Program

**S**tateless **S**olana **P**rogram. also known as "Compressed Program". A Smart contract that interacts with ZK-compressed state via the LightLayer. This includes regular Anchor programs that fully execute on-chain as well as programs that run custom off-chain computation over compressed state.

### Groth16

Groth16 is a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system used within Light for efficient proof generation and verification. Proofs are short (256 bytes / 128 bytes compressed) which is important for on-chain verificaiton on Solana. Groth16 proofs belong to the family of SNARKs.
