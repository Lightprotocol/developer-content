# Core concepts

Light Protocol's core primitive ZK Compression drastically reduces on-chain state costs while maintaining security, composability, and performance. ZK Compression allows developers to efficiently scale their applications to millions of users with the help of zero-knowledge proofs.

In the following sections, we'll dive into the core concepts that make ZK Compression possible:

* **Compressed Account Model**: Understand how compressed accounts differ from regular Solana accounts (not much!) and how they enhance efficiency.
* **State Trees**: Learn about the Merkle tree structure used to store compressed accounts and how it minimizes on-chain storage.
* **Validity Proofs**: Explore how the protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify data validity while keeping proof sizes small.
* **Lifecycle of a Transaction**: Follow the journey of a ZK-compressed transaction from creation to execution.
* **Limitations and Considerations**: Discover the trade-offs and scenarios where ZK Compression may or may not be the best solution.
