{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

This release includes various quality-of-life improvements, including for robustness and performance.

### Breaking changes

* **New program IDs**. The up-to-date list can be found [here](https://www.zkcompression.com/developers/devnet-addresses).
* **JS RPC client**: compressed account endpoints now get returned with a cursor that allows for proper pagination. therefore accounts must be accessed via `response.items.accounts` instead of `response.accounts`.

You can find a detailed list of all changes here:

### Upgrading from v0.5.0

* Redeploy your programs on devnet pointing to the [**new program IDs**](../developers/devnet-addresses.md#program-ids-and-accounts-from-27th-aug-2024-onward). You may also need to update your JS client's use of `getCompressedAccounts` according to the breaking changes highlighted above.

### Examples

* We added a new simple name service program reference implementation! It uses the latest releases [**here**](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/examples/name-service).
