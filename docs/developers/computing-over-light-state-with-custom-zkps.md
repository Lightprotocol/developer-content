# Computing over Light State with custom ZKPs

All state that is compressed via the LightLayer natively enables efficient computation via ZKPs.&#x20;

If you can describe or translate your computation into a groth16 circuit, you can run that computation over all Solana L1 state that is compressed via the LightLayer.

This prevents state fragmentation while enabling previously impossible types of applications and asynchronous computation on Solana.
